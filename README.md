## Idea:
[MapSwipeAnalytics](http://mapswipe.heigit.org/analytics/) is a website that brings together everything related to MapSwipe projects.

This includes a visualisation of the results (e.g. settlement layer), but also additional characteristics like agreement among volunteers, which is an important indicator for quality. Furthermore, you can monitor the progress of individual MapSwipe projects.

## Feedback:
Please note that we are still in the beta mode. We are working on improving the design as well as the analytical features. Your feedback is always welcome! Just post an issue to this repository.
